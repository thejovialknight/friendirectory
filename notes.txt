CSS: Cascading stylesheets
Linked to html with <link href="./file.css" rel="stylesheet">
Can be inlined in head with <style> element, or inlined in element with style attribute.

Selectors
Selectors are used to decide which elements have a style applied to them.

Type Selectors
p {
    color: green;
}
This is a selector for element type <p>

Universal selector 
* {
    font-family: Verdana;
}
Selects all elements of any type.

Class selector
HTML elements can have a class="grandpa" attribute, which is referenced by CSS by:
.grandpa {
    font-weight: 200;
}

Multiple classes
<p class="grandpa ants">
.grandpa {
    font-weight: 200;
}
.ants {
    text-transform: lowercase;
}

ID Selectors
Similar to class, but can only be used once per page, and can only be a single value.
<h1 id="grandma">
#grandma {
    font-family: Courier;
}

Attribute selector
[href] {
    color: #eee;
}
img[src*='panzer'] {
    height: 100px;
}
That last one targets all img elements in which the src contains the string "panzer"

Psuedo class selectors 
p:hover {
    background-color: lime;
}
Also includes :focus, :visited, :disabled, :active

Specificity
The order by which browser decides which styles will be displayed.
Best practice is to style elements with lowest specificity degree by default.
The order is as follows: id, class, type.
So this means, start out using a type selector, if you need more specific, use class, and then id.

Chaining
h1.special {
    Only selects h1 elements that have the special class. Won't touch non h1 specials, presumably.
}

Descendant combinator
<ul class='main-list'>
    <li></li> etc
</ul>
.main-list li {
    will select all li elements that are nested within elements of class main-list.
}
li h4 {
    will select all h4 elements inside of li elements.
}

Multiple selectors
h1 .grandpa {
    Will select all h1 elements and all elements of class grandpa
}

The Box Model
Everything lives in a box.
Background color changes the color of this box.
Boxes have the following aspects:
    Dimensions:
    Borders:
    Paddings:
    Margins:
They also have the following properties:
    width and height: w and h of content area
    padding: space between content area and border
    border: thickness and style of border surrounding content and padding
    margin: space between border and outside edge of element
    overflow: behavior if content overflows (scroll, hidden, auto, clip, visible)

px
Setting values by pixel makes it the same size on all devices. Yikes!

ARPANET
Precursor to the internet. Connected supercomputing centers run by the government and universities.

TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/internet protocol)
Created in the 1970s. Standards for transferring data. Adopted in the early 1980s.

Internet vs WWW
The internet is the network between computing devices, the world wide web is a collection
of interlinked websites and resources to browse.

Clients and Servers
Yep.

HTTP Status Codes
200: OK: Request succeeded
301: Moved Permenantly: Resources has been moved and client redirected
404: Not found: Resource not found
500: Internal Server Error: Unexpected error.

Steps to seeing a page
1. Server processes request and sends back HTML file to client.
2. Browser searches for html elements and makes additional HTTP requests as needed
    - CSS stylesheets
    - Images and videos
    - Javascript files
without javascript the webpage is known as a static webpage.

Web 2.0
A dynamic user experience responds to input without forcing page reload.
Emphasis on user generated content and social sharing.

Technical advances that led to web 2.0
jQuery: first js framework that could fetch data while webpage was running.
Rise of web frameworks that connected to database like Spring, Django, and Ruby-On-Rails.

Current trends
Responsive web design: CSS< media queries, relative units(?). Can adjust based on size of window.
Mobile apps and devices: more likely to access internet via apps rather than browser.

HTML
The skeleton of all web pages. The structure to the content.

CSS
The presentation and styling of the HTML content. Linked to html with a <link> element.

Javascript
Any site that isn't static probably uses js.
    - Popup ads 
    - Animated graphics
    - Interactive audio and video 
    - Maps 

Events
JS can react to browser events in real time.
    - User clicking button
    - User pressing key
    - Video file loaded
    - Resize window
    - Hovering over text

JS in HTML
Can be directly embedded with <script> tag.
HTML attributes can set events: <button onclick="changeColor()">Text</button>, where changeColor() is a JS function within a script.

SQL: Structured query language
Stores information in tables, organized in rows and columns.
SELECT * FROM users = select all (*) data from users table.

Back-end vs Front-end
Back end happens on remote server you can't see. Formatting and storing data, making it scaleable.
Front end has to do with information display to users. Gets data from back end and displays to user.

MDN: Mozilla Developer Network 
Widely accredited resource for looking up information on all sorts of web topics. Should perhaps
be first choice when wanting to know more about a topic.
